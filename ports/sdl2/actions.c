/**
 *    Name:        actions.c
 *    Description: the keys and game controller buttons of each player's actions, which are held and pressed
 *                 this frame, and the file that keeps them (controls.ini)
 *    Version:     0.1.0
 *    Created:     19-10-2026
 *    Modified:    25-10-2026
 *    Author:      Sebastian Toyos
 *
 *    The defaults below; controls.ini, beside the executable, keeps what the console's CONTROLS screen
 *    changes: a section a player, "[player 1]", and a line an action, "jump = Z, Space | a" (SDL's names of
 *    the keys, then of the buttons). A player's game controller is the one plugged in in their turn; its
 *    left stick counts as its directional pad.
